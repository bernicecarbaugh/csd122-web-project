          For the past 15 years, she has been building agile, targeted,
          cost-effective solutions at Expedia. Her specialty has been developing

          In 2019, Bernice decided to become a developer and has been working
          furiously towards that goal, taking programming classes at community
          colleges, completing a web development boot camp, reading articles,
          watching tutorials. She's also starting a Masters of Science in
          Computer Science program at Georgia Tech.

          While not coding, Bernice leads a full life raising a family,
          volunteering, managing real estate investments, gardening, hiking and
          learning.
